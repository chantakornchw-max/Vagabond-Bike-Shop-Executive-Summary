## Project Background
This End-to-End Analytics Project was developed to transform raw transactional data into a high-impact executive dashboard. By integrating SQL-based data processing with Power BI visualization, the project provides a comprehensive view of the company's health over a three-year period (2011–2013).

Vagabond's Bike Shop is a global retail business specializing in high-performance bicycles, components, and accessories. As the business expanded across multiple continents, the need for a centralized, data-driven system to monitor performance became critical for executive decision-making.

Key Objectives:

● Revenue Trend Analysis: Track monthly and yearly revenue performance to identify seasonality and growth patterns.

● Market Insights: Visualize geographic sales distribution to identify top-performing markets.

● Customer Demographics: Understand the revenue contribution across different age groups to optimize marketing efforts.

● Product Performance: Identify high-value products and monitor their impact on the total revenue stream.

## Data Structure
Vagabond's Bike Shop's database consists of three tables: fact_sales, dim_customers, and dim_products, as shown below.
